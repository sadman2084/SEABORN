## Introduction
This script demonstrates how to create a categorical plot (catplot) using Seaborn to visualize the relationship between numerical and categorical data.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed before running the script:

```bash
pip install matplotlib pandas seaborn
```

## Code Explanation

### Importing Required Libraries
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
import pandas as pd
```
This imports Matplotlib for plotting, Pandas for handling data, and Seaborn for creating advanced visualizations.

### Loading Dataset
```python
data_load = sns.load_dataset("tips")
```
Loads the built-in "tips" dataset provided by Seaborn, which contains information about restaurant bills, including tip amounts, customer gender, and table size.

### Creating the Categorical Plot
```python
sns.catplot(x="size", y="tip", data=data_load, hue="sex",
            palette="Accent", height=10)
```
This command generates a categorical plot with various customizations:
- `x="size"`: The categorical variable "size" (number of people at a table) is displayed on the x-axis.
- `y="tip"`: The numerical variable "tip" is displayed on the y-axis.
- `data=data_load`: Uses the "tips" dataset.
- `hue="sex"`: Differentiates the data by gender using different colors.
- `palette="Accent"`: Uses the "Accent" color palette for styling.
- `height=10`: Sets the height of the plot.

### Displaying the Plot
```python
plt.show()
```
Renders the categorical plot on the screen.

## Summary
This script uses Seaborn to create a categorical plot that visualizes the relationship between table size and tip amount, distinguishing between male and female customers.

## Notes
- The dataset "tips" must be available within Seaborn.
- Ensure that all required libraries are installed and imported properly.
